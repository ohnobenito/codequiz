OVERVIEW:
For this project, I worked on creating a multiple choice quiz that users could take to test their coding knowledge. To play the user races the clock to answer the questions earning time by getting them right, and losing time if the answer is incorrect. The quiz is responsive on all screens, and incorporates JavaScript to dynamically enhance it's functionality.

**The following tasks were created to have this bratty little quiz:**

- Created a function to push questions from JS and start a timer when the user hits start
- Created a function that sorts through the questions and stops when none are left OR when the clock hits 0
- Utilized bootstrap for an easier userface that is responsive on all devices
- Utilized CSS for a unique, clean page
